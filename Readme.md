## Overview
QBot is a solution designed for classroom teaching scenarios which allow teachers, tutors and students to intelligently answer each other's questions within the Microsoft Teams collaboration platform. It leverages the power of Azure Cognitive Services, in particular QnA Maker to achieve this.

The solution was originally developed, and is currently deployed for the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia.

Once the app is deployed to a Team, a student can ask a question on the channel by @tagging QBot. QBot will respond with the correct answer, or tag a group of demonstrators allowing them to collaborate on a response. Accepted answers are subsequently used to train Qbot for future questions.
